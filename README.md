# Banking Application - Java Project

## Description
The Banking Application is a Java application that simulates basic banking operations like mobile recharge, fund transfer etc. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing accounts, transactions, and other essential banking functions. This project is an implementation of the DAO (Data Access Object) pattern in Java, using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to interact with a MySQL database. The DAO pattern is an approach to organize the persistence layer in an application, separating data access operations from business logic. JDBC has been used to develop this system which includes JDBC Driver, Connections, DAO implementations and exception handling. MySQL has been used for database.

The application has a user-friendly interface, providing an interactive experience for the users. Upon logging in, the user is presented with a dashboard that displays all available services. The user can then select the desired service and perform the necessary actions. Furthermore, the application provides a convenient way for users to keep track of their transaction history. Users can view their transaction history, which includes information such as the transaction amount, date, and the recipient's username. This feature is particularly useful for individuals who need to keep track of their financial activities for record-keeping or budgeting purposes.
